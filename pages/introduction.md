<!-- 
"Let's break it down. Test-Driven Development is basically a simple mantra: _write tests before you write code._<br>
Sounds counterintuitive, right? 'How can I test something that doesn't exist yet?'<br>
Well, that's the trick--it forces you to think about what you really need your code to do before you even start coding.<br>
This approach is encapsulated in the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

- **Red**: Write a test that initially fails because the functionality isn't implemented.
- **Green**: Write just enough code to make the test pass.
- **Refactor**: Clean up the code without breaking your tests.

It's like writing a cheat sheet for an exam before you even open the textbook. <br>
It might seem weird at first, but it makes the entire process more reliable.
