#### So, What is TDD?

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

![TDD Cycle](/tdd.png){width=600px lazy}

<span>TDD is a process where tests guide the development of code, focusing on small, iterative steps:
  <span v-mark.underline.orange>Write a failing test</span>,
  <span v-mark.underline.orange>make it pass</span>, and
  <span v-mark.underline.orange>improve the code.</span>
</span>

"Let's break it down. Test-Driven Development is basically a simple mantra: _write tests before you write code._<br>
Sounds counterintuitive, right? 'How can I test something that doesn't exist yet?'<br>
Well, that's the trick--it forces you to think about what you really need your code to do before you even start coding.<br>
This approach is encapsulated in the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

- **Red**: Write a test that initially fails because the functionality isn't implemented.
- **Green**: Write just enough code to make the test pass.
- **Refactor**: Clean up the code without breaking your tests.

It's like writing a cheat sheet for an exam before you even open the textbook. <br>
It might seem weird at first, but it makes the entire process more reliable.

#### Brief History of TDD

<!--
“Before we jump into the Bowling Game Kata, let’s take a moment to appreciate where TDD comes from. <br>
It was popularized by Kent Beck in the late 1990s as part of Extreme Programming—or XP, not the operating system, but a methodology for writing high-quality software. <br>
TDD isn’t just about writing tests; it’s about using tests to guide the design of your code. And now, it’s a core tool for developers who want to write bug-free code without losing their minds.”
