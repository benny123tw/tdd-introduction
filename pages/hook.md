Have you ever spent hours fixing a bug, only to create another one? <br>
[Pause and look around with a knowing smile.] <br>
Yeah, me neither - just kidding! We've all been there. <br>
Every time we fix one bug, it's like a sneaky gremlin pops up and says, 'Not so fast, buddy!'<br>
It's like playing bowling with a slippery ball - no matter how hard you try, something always goes wrong.<br>
